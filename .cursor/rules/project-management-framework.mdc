# Agent Project Management Framework

## Project Organization Structure

All projects are managed through a unified directory structure in the root of each repository:

```bash
.cursor-projects/
├── planned/       # Projects that are defined but not yet started
├── active/        # Projects currently being worked on
├── completed/     # Projects that have been finished
```

## Project Lifecycle

Each project follows a specific lifecycle:

1. **Planning Phase**: Create a new markdown file in `.cursor-projects/planned/` with the naming format `YYYY-MM-DD-project-name.md`
2. **Activation**: When starting work, move the file to `.cursor-projects/active/`
3. **Completion**: When finished, move the file to `.cursor-projects/completed/`

## Project File Structure

Each project markdown file should follow this template:

```markdown
# Project: [Project Name]
- **Created**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Status**: [Planned|Active|Completed]
- **Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Context & Requirements
[Detailed description of the project, its purpose, and requirements]

## Development Plan
### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Notes & References
[Any relevant notes, links, or references for the project]
```

## Project Management Workflow

1. **When planning a new project**:
   - Create a new markdown file in `.cursor-projects/planned/`
   - Fill out all sections of the template
   - Define clear phases and tasks

2. **When starting work on a project**:
   - Move the file from `.cursor-projects/planned/` to `.cursor-projects/active/`
   - Update the Status field to "Active"
   - Update the Last Updated field

3. **During project work**:
   - Check off tasks as they're completed using `- [x]` syntax
   - Add any new tasks that emerge
   - Update the Last Updated field after each session

4. **When completing a project**:
   - Ensure all tasks are checked off
   - Move the file from `.cursor-projects/active/` to `.cursor-projects/completed/`
   - Update the Status field to "Completed"
   - Update the Last Updated field

5. **When revisiting a project for fixes or enhancements**:
   - First review all related project files in `.cursor-projects/completed/`
   - Reference the original project file for context
   - Create a new project file for the fix/enhancement if substantial
   - For minor fixes, note them in the original project file

## Project Continuity

All previous project files serve as a knowledge base for future work. Before starting any new projects or fixes:

1. Search through existing project files for relevant context
2. Reference related past work in new project files
3. Build upon previous solutions when applicable

This approach ensures continuity of knowledge and prevents redundant work or repeated errors.
