# Project: Refactor Next.js Time Tracking App
- **Created**: 2024-07-28
- **Status**: Completed
- **Last Updated**: 2024-07-29

## Context & Requirements
The Next.js time tracking application (`nextjs-time-tracking-app`) has undergone initial development and several rounds of feature additions and UI adjustments. During this process, debugging code (like `console.log` statements) may have been left behind, and some code structures or methods might be unused or could be optimized.

This project aims to perform a general refactoring pass to improve code quality, maintainability, and potentially performance.

**Requirements:**
- Remove all unnecessary `console.log` statements.
- Identify and remove unused variables, functions, components, and imports.
- Review existing components for potential simplification or composition opportunities.
- Ensure adherence to TypeScript best practices (avoid `any` type, use specific types).
- Verify code formatting and linting rules are consistently applied.
- Ensure no functional regressions are introduced.

## Development Plan
### Phase 1: Code Cleanup & Identification
- [x] **Task 1.1:** Search for and remove all `console.log` statements throughout the `nextjs-time-tracking-app` directory.
- [x] **Task 1.2:** Utilize ESLint (`next lint`) or TypeScript compiler checks (`tsc --noEmit`) to identify unused variables and imports.
- [x] **Task 1.3:** Manually review components, hooks, and utility functions for potentially dead code (functions/components defined but never called/rendered).

### Phase 2: Refactoring & Optimization
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Refactor components identified in Phase 1 for better structure or reusability (if applicable).
- [x] **Task 2.2:** Review type safety, replacing any instances of `any` with specific types where possible.
- [x] **Task 2.3:** Address any complex logic that could be simplified or made more readable.

### Phase 3: Verification & Formatting
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Run linters (`eslint`) and formatters (`prettier`) to ensure code style consistency. Fix any reported issues.
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Perform a build (`next build`) to catch any build-time errors.
- [x] **Task 3.3:** Manually test key application functionality (Dashboard view, Project list, Time Entry list, Stat updates, Timeline interaction) to ensure no regressions.
