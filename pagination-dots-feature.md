# Pagination Dots Feature

## Overview
Added pagination dots to the project selection screen to provide users with a visual indicator of their current position among available projects.

## Implementation Details

### What's Been Added
- Added a row of pagination dots at the bottom of the project selection screen
- The dot corresponding to the currently selected project is filled (solid white)
- All other dots are outlined to indicate unselected projects
- Dots are spaced evenly and centered horizontally
- Project name text position has been adjusted to make room for the dots

### Technical Approach
The pagination dots were implemented by modifying the `drawProjectSelectionScreen` method in `DisplayController.cpp`:

1. **Created visual indicators:**
   - Used `fillCircle` for the selected project (solid dot)
   - Used `drawCircle` for unselected projects (outline dots)
   - Set dot radius to 2 pixels with 4 pixel spacing between dots

2. **Layout positioning:**
   - Dots are centered horizontally based on the total number of projects
   - Positioned 7 pixels from the bottom of the screen
   - Adjusted the project name position to accommodate the dots

3. **Handling edge cases:**
   - Only displays dots when there are multiple projects
   - Maintains proper spacing regardless of the number of projects

## User Experience Improvements
- Users can now easily see:
  - How many total projects are available
  - Which project is currently selected
  - Their position within the project list
- Follows familiar UI patterns seen in carousels and sliders
- Provides a better spatial understanding of the project navigation

## Technical Details
- Each dot is 4 pixels in diameter (2 pixel radius)
- Dots are spaced 4 pixels apart from each other
- Implementation adds minimal overhead to the display routine
- Uses the built-in circle drawing functions of the Adafruit GFX library
